        "First, it transforms inputs into queries, keys, and values using three separate nn.Linear layers (matrix multiplications). Then it computes attention scores by multiplying queries with keys transposed. Next, it scales the scores by dividing by square root of dimension and applies softmax to get probabilities. Finally, it multiplies attention weights with values to get context vectors.\n",
